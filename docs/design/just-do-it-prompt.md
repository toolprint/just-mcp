# Just-Do-It Prompt Design Document

## Overview

This document outlines the design and implementation of MCP prompt support for the just-mcp server, starting with a "do-it" prompt that enables natural language task discovery and execution using semantic search.

## Background

The just-mcp server currently transforms justfiles into MCP tools, allowing AI assistants to discover and execute automation tasks. Adding prompt support will enable users to use natural language to find and run tasks without needing to know exact task names.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **MCP Prompt Protocol**: Implement standard MCP prompt methods (`prompts/list`, `prompts/get`)
2. **Natural Language Interface**: Accept user requests like "build the project" and find matching justfile tasks
3. **Semantic Search Integration**: Use existing vector search capabilities to find relevant tasks
4. **Safety Mechanisms**: Detect potentially dangerous commands and recommend confirmation
5. **User Feedback**: Explain chosen tasks and provide fallback suggestions
6. **Asset Bundling**: Store prompt templates in assets/ directory, bundled at build time

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Security**: Follow existing security patterns and validation
2. **Performance**: Reuse existing vector search infrastructure
3. **Modularity**: Integrate cleanly with existing architecture
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Don't break existing tool-only clients

## Architecture

### High-Level Design

```text
MCP Client → Server Handler → PromptRegistry → DoItPrompt → VectorSearchManager
                                    ↓              ↓             ↓
                              Prompt Templates → SearchAdapter → LibSqlVectorStore
                                    ↓              ↓
                              ConfirmationManager → ToolExecutor
```

### Core Components

#### 1. PromptRegistry

- Manages available prompts (similar to existing ToolRegistry)
- Loads prompt templates from bundled assets
- Provides prompt metadata and execution capabilities
- Thread-safe with async support

#### 2. DoItPrompt

- Implements the main "do-it" prompt logic
- Accepts user arguments and converts to search queries
- Integrates with VectorSearchManager for semantic search
- Handles threshold-based result filtering
- Provides user explanations and task selection

#### 3. ConfirmationManager

- Detects potentially dangerous commands using pattern matching
- Maintains configurable patterns for destructive operations
- Provides risk assessment and recommendation logic

#### 4. SearchAdapter

- Bridges between prompt system and existing vector search
- Formats queries for semantic search
- Processes results and applies similarity thresholds
- Converts search results to executable task information

### Integration Points

#### Existing Systems

- **VectorSearchManager**: Reused for semantic task discovery
- **ToolRegistry**: Pattern followed for prompt management
- **MCP Server Handler**: Extended to support prompt methods
- **Security Validation**: Applied to all prompt-triggered executions
- **Asset Bundling**: Extended to include prompt templates

## Technical Specifications

### Prompt Template Format

```markdown
# Do It - Natural Language Task Execution

You are helping a user execute justfile tasks using natural language. The user has requested: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Your Task

1. **Search for matching tasks** using semantic search with the query "a command to do $ARGUMENTS"
2. **Evaluate results** against similarity threshold (default: 0.8)
3. **Choose appropriate action** based on search results:

### If High Confidence Match (≥0.8 similarity):
- **REQUIRED**: Tell the user exactly which task you chose and why
- **REQUIRED**: Explain what you are about to execute
- If the command seems dangerous (delete, remove, format, etc.), **MAY** ask for confirmation first
- Execute the appropriate MCP tool call

### If Low Confidence (< 0.8 similarity):
- Explain that no task matched closely enough
- Describe the closest result found and its similarity score
- Ask if that's what they meant or request clarification
- Be ready to search again with refined query

## Example Interactions

User: "build the project"
→ Search: "a command to do build the project"
→ Found: `just_build` (similarity: 0.92)
→ Response: "I found the 'build' task which compiles the Rust project. I'll execute `just build` for you."

User: "clean everything"
→ Search: "a command to do clean everything" 
→ Found: `just_clean_all` (similarity: 0.85)
→ Response: "I found 'clean-all' which removes all build artifacts and caches. This is potentially destructive. Should I proceed with `just clean-all`?"
```

### MCP Protocol Messages

#### Prompt List Response

```json
{
  "prompts": [
    {
      "name": "do-it",
      "description": "Execute justfile tasks using natural language",
      "arguments": [
        {
          "name": "request",
          "description": "What you want to do (e.g., 'build the project', 'run tests')",
          "required": true
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Prompt Get Response

```json
{
  "description": "Execute justfile tasks using natural language",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user", 
      "content": {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "build the application"
      }
    },

      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Configuration Schema

```toml
[prompts]
similarity_threshold = 0.8
enable_dangerous_command_detection = true
require_confirmation_for_destructive = true

[prompts.dangerous_patterns]
patterns = ["rm", "delete", "format", "sudo", "kill", "remove"]
```

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation

- All user arguments validated using existing security patterns
- Search queries sanitized before vector search execution
- Tool execution uses existing security validation pipeline

### Dangerous Command Detection

- Pattern-based detection for potentially destructive operations
- Configurable risk levels and confirmation requirements
- Audit logging for all prompt-triggered executions

### Resource Limits

- Reuse existing resource limits for search operations
- Timeout protection for prompt processing
- Memory limits for search result processing

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- `prompts/registry_test.rs`: PromptRegistry functionality
- `prompts/do_it_test.rs`: DoItPrompt logic and edge cases
- `prompts/confirmation_test.rs`: Dangerous command detection
- `prompts/search_adapter_test.rs`: Vector search integration

### Integration Tests

- `tests/prompts/mcp_protocol_test.rs`: MCP prompt protocol compliance
- `tests/prompts/end_to_end_test.rs`: Full prompt execution workflows
- `tests/prompts/security_test.rs`: Security validation and edge cases

### Test Data

- Sample justfiles with various task types
- Mock vector search results for testing
- Dangerous command test cases
- Edge cases (empty results, malformed inputs)

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies

- Reuse existing VectorSearchManager connection pooling
- Cache prompt templates after initial load
- Efficient similarity threshold filtering
- Minimize memory allocation in search processing

### Monitoring

- Prometheus metrics for prompt usage and performance
- Search latency and result quality tracking
- Error rate monitoring for prompt executions

## Future Enhancements

### Additional Prompts

- **help**: "Help me understand this justfile"
- **explain**: "Explain what this task does"
- **suggest**: "What tasks are available for X?"

### Advanced Features

- Multi-turn conversations for task parameter gathering
- Learning from user feedback to improve search quality
- Integration with external documentation sources
- Custom prompt templates per justfile

## Migration and Rollout

### Backward Compatibility

- Existing tool-only MCP clients continue to work unchanged
- New prompt capabilities exposed as optional server features
- Graceful degradation when vector search unavailable

### Deployment Strategy

1. Feature flag for prompt support during development
2. Gradual rollout with monitoring and feedback collection
3. Performance validation under production load
4. Full release with comprehensive documentation

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

Once the prompt registry is initialized with vector search, users can execute tasks using natural language:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "prompts/list", 
  "id": 1
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "prompts": [
      {
        "name": "do-it",
        "description": "Execute justfile tasks using natural language",
        "arguments": [
          {
            "name": "request",
            "description": "What you want to do (e.g., 'build the project', 'run tests')",
            "required": true
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Executing a Prompt

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "prompts/get",
  "id": 2,
  "params": {
    "name": "do-it", 
    "arguments": {
      "request": "build the project"
    }
  }
}
```

Response for high-confidence match:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "result": {
    "description": "Executed prompt 'do-it' successfully",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "I found the 'build' task which compiles the Rust project (similarity: 0.92). I'll execute `just build` for you."
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Integration Code Example

```rust
use just_mcp::prompts::{PromptRegistry, SearchAdapter, PromptConfig};
use just_mcp::vector_search::VectorSearchManager;

// Initialize with vector search
let vector_manager = Arc::new(VectorSearchManager::new(/* ... */));
let search_provider = Arc::new(VectorSearchProvider::new(vector_manager));
let config = PromptConfig::default().with_similarity_threshold(0.8);
let search_adapter = Arc::new(SearchAdapter::with_provider(search_provider, config.clone()));

// Create and configure prompt registry
let prompt_registry = PromptRegistryBuilder::new()
    .with_config(config)
    .with_search_adapter(search_adapter)
    .build()
    .await?;

// Add to server
let server = Server::new(transport)
    .with_prompt_registry(prompt_registry);
```

## Key Features Delivered

1. **Natural Language Interface**: Users can request tasks like "build the project" instead of memorizing exact task names
2. **Semantic Search Integration**: Leverages existing vector search infrastructure for intelligent task matching
3. **Safety Mechanisms**: Automatic detection of potentially dangerous commands with confirmation prompts
4. **MCP Protocol Compliance**: Full integration with Model Context Protocol for Claude Code compatibility
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: 53 passing tests covering all components and edge cases
6. **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with reusable components

## Claude Code Integration

When just-mcp server is configured with prompt support, users in Claude Code can use:

```
/mcp__just__do-it build the application
```

The prompt will:

1. Use semantic search to find matching justfile tasks
2. Explain which task was chosen and why  
3. Check for dangerous operations and request confirmation if needed
4. Execute the appropriate `just` command

## Conclusion

The just-do-it prompt feature significantly enhances the user experience of the just-mcp server by providing a natural language interface for task discovery and execution. The design leverages existing infrastructure while maintaining the project's security-first approach and modular architecture.

The implementation follows a phased approach that allowed for iterative development and testing, ensuring a robust and secure solution that integrates seamlessly with the existing codebase. All planned features have been successfully implemented and tested.
